##huetoys

My collection of Python scripts for playing with Philips Hue and LivingColors bulbs.

My code relies on the work of Nathanaël Lécaudé at https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue

If you find it useful, I'd love to hear that, but it's not required. 

Of course, use this code at your own risk. If it empties your bank accounts, purchases thousands of dollars of cat toys with your credit cards, and burns your house down, I will feel bad for you, but it's not my fault.
